Developed a credit default risk analysis model using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm under the guidance of Dr. Prof. Niladri Chatterjee as a part of Capstone Project for my P.G Diploma Degree in AI-ML at IIT Delhi. The model accurately predicts client default based on complex client data, achieving a validation score of 0.8 and a precision of 0.55. Additionally, the model was submitted to a Kaggle competition, where it ranked in the top 10.
