Developed a credit default risk analysis model using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm under the guidance of Dr. Prof. Niladri Chatterjee at IIT Delhi. The model accurately predicts client default based on complex client data, achieving a validation score of 0.8 and a precision of 0.55. Additionally, the model was submitted to a Kaggle competition, where it ranked in the top 10.
